# Application-1: SoloLearn

### 1. Application Functionality:
	SoloLearn is a must have for every programmer in this world. It provides rich coding content from beginner to advanced level. Whether you need to revise your programming concepts or learn the basics from very scratch, “SoloLearn” is the answer. We can also get our doubts solved by asking questions on coding forums that includes millions of coders who are ready to solve our doubts. Through SoloLearn we can learn any programming topic, try coding challenges, ask questions on forums, and many such things.
### 2.	The reason for choosing this application: 
		The reason I choose this app is because Its one of kind app in the market. There may be similar coding apps but nothing can be compared to SoloLearn. This app allows me to get basic knowledge on any programming topic, thus it eliminates the need for searching videos on youtube or looking for articles on google. Another thing that I like about this app is that it provides a lot of interesting coding challenges through which I can get the grip on my chosen programming language. The app also gives me certificates and badges which encourages me to try to solve more challenges.
### 3.	Benefits for the users: 
		I have seen many people from other fields(such as banking) that wish to learn programming. The main problem they face is that they just don’t know from where they should start. Through SoloLearn they can get very basic knowledge which can be easily understood by a non-computer background person. This app explains each programming function in depth and right after that it asks us a question related to that function. This app will take users from very basic level concepts towards more advanced ones. The interesting thing here is that SoloLearn provides all these features for free. Users using SoloLearn no longer need to search programming articles on google or pay for an online programming course. SoloLearn is the app if an user wants to learn in-depth programming for free.
### 4.	Application Key Features:
			 a.	 Built in programming editor: 
					This is my most favorite feature of this app. This app provides us with a built in complete editor through which we can write and run code from our mobile itself. The editor supports many programming languages which allows us to write code of various different languages.
			 b.  Q&A Discussions: 
					This is another useful feature of this app which allows an user to solve almost any of his/her doubts by simply asking it in discussions. This discussions are referred by many expert coders which are willing to solve our doubts. Question related to any programming language. All of the trending questions of that particular day gets appeared on the discussions part of the app. It will be also easy for the user to just search the question rather than writing it since many of the frequently asked questions would have already been answered.
			 c.  Play against opponents:  
					This feature of the app allows us to play coding challenges  against random coders using the similar app. In the challenge the app basically asks us a series of questions and keeps a track of number of correct/wrong answered questions. Same questions gets asked to the opponent as well. In the end whoever has answered the most number of correct questions will be declared as the winner. The one thing that I like about this feature is that it encourages learning in a fun way. It would be very boring if the app just showed us the concepts and then asked us questions. Instead we get compete against fellow coders and learn.
			 d.	 Coding Challenges:  
					A lot of coding challenges gets posted on the coding challenges section of the app. Through these challenges we can put our programming skills to test. The challenges of almost every programming language can be found here. These type of challenges are particularly useful for the types of programmer who have mastered their basics and now want to move towards advanced level. A user can try to first solve the challenge on his own and if he cannot solve the challenge then he can see the solution posted by other coders.
### 5.  Weaknesses and possible improvements: 
			There aren’t many weaknesses associated with this app, but still I found some areas in which the app can be improved a little bit. The first issue that I found was that the app didn’t had a proper welcome tutorial when the application gets launched for the very first time. So the developers must include a thorough tutorial for the first time users. The another issue that I found was that all of the parts of the app such as topics and coding challenges weren’t organized in a proper way and looked congested, this could be overwhelming for the new user. So proper organization of the app content is required.
			
# Application-2: Guides by Lonely Planet

### 1. Application Functionality:
			This app is a must have for every traveller. The current of version of the app contains 100+ city guides. The guides includes detailed information about the cities such as “Must see locations”, ”Tours and activities”, ”Eat and sleep” and many similar contents. This app can be considered as a pocket tour guide. It provides you with all the content that a tour guide will tell you, and maybe even more that that. With this app, the user will surely be able to explore the city on his/her own. 
### 2.	The reason for choosing this application: 
			The main reason that I choose this app was based on my own personal experience. When I first arrived to Halifax I absolutely knew nothing about the city. I had to ask the taxi driver about the must see locations and similar information. In addition to this, I didn’t even knew the fare charges of buses or ferry, which is something that is required if a traveller wants to make a budget. If I had this app during that time, then it surely would have been an awesome experience.  This app covers all the issues such as budget planning, transportation cost, must see locations and much more useful content.  
### 3.	Benefits for the users: 
			The obvious benefit for the users is that they are getting a tour guide for free. Sure all of this information that this app provides can be searched from google but the app is way more convenient since all the travel relevant information can be found from a single place itself, which eliminates the need of searching each individual content such must-see, hotel, restaurants on google(which can be tiring).
### 4.	Application Key Features:
			a.	Budget-Planning:
					This is my most favorite feature of the app. This feature enables a traveller to efficiently make a budget plan since it gives the general daily costs including low, mid and high range costs. It also tells you what type of hotel, transportation, restaurant, attractions you can get in a particular budget. There is also a built in currency converter that the traveller can use to manage the money according to his/her own currency. Other information such as tipping is also provided in budget section.
			b.	Transport:
					This is another great feature of the app that gives you all the necessary transport information. It provides you all the transport options which are available in that particular city such as bus and cabs. There is also a direct link in cabs section through which a user can directly rent a cab. It also provides the bus rates and ferry rates to the user.
			c.	All-in-one: 
					The main app screen prompts the user to enter the desired city. As soon as the user enters the name of the city, it shows us the screen that almost includes everything like “SEE”, “EAT”, “SLEEP”, “SHOP”, “DRINK”. From one place you can find must-see locations, restaurants to eat, hotel to sleep, markets to shop, and bars to drink and have fun. Whenever a user clicks any hotel or a must-see location then the app instantly provides all the necessary information related to that hotel(cost, amenities, ratings) or location(its history, importance). The one thing I like about this section is that it does not redirect a user to some website for providing the information, all the information is provided from the app itself. This section of the app also displays the city’s famous tours and activities along with the cost. As soon as we click on any activity, all the necessary information related to that activity is shown to us.
			d.  Everything works offline(maps included) :
					If a traveller does not have an internet connection then this would not be an issue with this app, since it can provide all the content including maps even when offline. So this obviously saves a traveller the roaming charges. The reason why this app works in offline mode is that a user needs to download the city guide first and then he/she will be able to use it offline. Once downloaded, the users will no longer need an internet connection to explore the city on their own.
### 5.  Weaknesses and possible improvements: 
			From my own personal expirience of using the app, I didn’t found out any major issues on the app. But still there are some areas such as maps in which the app can be improved. The built-in maps provided in the app were not aesthetic looking, meaning that they looked plain and boring. Another issue with the map is the location accuracy, it is very weak and not accurate at all. So this is something the app developers needs to work on:- (1) Make maps more attractive (2) Improve location accuracy.
